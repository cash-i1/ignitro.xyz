        <h2>what</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Enviroment Up!</strong> is a game where you go up and up and up for ever.
        </p>
        
        <h2>the gameplay</h2>
        <p>In <strong>Enviroment Up!</strong>, you go up forever, jumping on flatforms automatically. If you touch pollution, you will be pushed down and get +1 pollution score (which is bad) but if you touch a non-pollution, you are boosted up and get +1 non-pollution score.

        If you have more pollution score than non-pollution score, the screen slowly starts to turn red and fade to black unless you get your pollution score higher.</p>
